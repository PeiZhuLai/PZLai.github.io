*****Sophomore

As the final presentation date approached during my Experimental Physics courses, I recognized my limited presentation skills. Seeing this as an opportunity for personal growth and community contribution, I joined the YongLin Education Foundation as a remedial education teacher at Hope Elementary School.Securing this role involved passing a teaching demonstration interview and participating in a comprehensive three-day workshop to renew the remedial education license for three semesters. The YongLin Education Foundation's remedial educational program aims to provide educational and financial support to students facing academic challenges due to economic disadvantages.

Engaging with this initiative was a privilege, dedicating two hours per week across two sessions to assist five students. My responsibilities included aiding them in completing homework assignments and addressing gaps in their mathematical understanding. However, the teaching process posed unforeseen challenges. For instance, one student had doctor-confirmed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite struggling to focus and interrupting frequently, I patiently guided him back to tasks and addressed his math difficulties.Two other students, from families with special occupations, required early sex education and encouragement. Guiding them through these discussions was both challenging and rewarding. Moreover, another student demonstrated significant academic improvement, almost reaching the academic levels of their peers by the conclusion of my one-year engagement.

This teaching experience significantly improved my presentation skills and had a profound impact on my academic journey, providing invaluable practical experience and shaping my approach to education.
