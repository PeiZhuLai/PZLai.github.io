At the end of my sophomore year, I became part of the experimental high-energy physics group under the guidance of Prof. Chia-Ming Kuo at National Central University (NCU), Taiwan, initiating my undergraduate project and later my master's thesis. My initial project involved employing multivariate techniques for energy regression of b-jets, utilizing MC samples derived from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). By training 18 variables in t$`\bar{t}`$, I achieved substantial enhancements. Notably, in the test sample and VH production sample, the resolution of b-jets improved by 8% in jet energy resolution and an impressive 50% in jet energy scale.
